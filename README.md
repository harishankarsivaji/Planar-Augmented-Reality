# Planar Augmented Reality

- To compute the projection from a planar target to a real-world image in real-time.
- Use your web-cam to capture images of a checkerboard which you will track using OpenCV and then overlay another image on top            of the image which is aligned with the checkerboard.
In effect you will use plane-to-plane calibration to perform planar based augmented reality (AR).
